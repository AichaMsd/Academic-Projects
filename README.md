# Academic-Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository for Machine Learning and Data Science academic assignments! 
In this repository, you'll find a collection of my academic assignments and projects completed during my Master's degree studies in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science.

These assignments cover a range of topics, including Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning Algorithms, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Web Scraping and more. Each assignment is accompanied by detailed explanations of the methods used in an academic report format, as well as the results obtained.

As a student of machine learning and data science, I am constantly seeking to improve my skills and deepen my understanding of the field. This repository is a reflection of my passion for the subject and my commitment to academic excellence.

Whether you're a fellow student looking for inspiration for your own assignments or a seasoned practitioner interested in exploring new techniques, I invite you to explore my work and share your feedback. Let's learn together and push the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning and data science!
